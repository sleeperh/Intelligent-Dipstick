# Intelligent Dipstick
 
## Getting Started

### Download and Install Source Code
1. Download the project zip and extract it in a folder of your choice. 
2. Within the Intelligent-Dipstick-main/src folder are two subfolders: Capstone_Sensors and Capstone_Gateway. Move Capstone_Sensors and Capstone_Gateway folders to the computer's Arduino folder, typically C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\Arduino
3. Follow the rest of the instructions outlined below

### Parts Needed
* 1 ESP32 Dev Kit C v4
* 1 Screw Terminal Block Breakout Board for ES32 Dev Kit C
* 1 ESP32 Dev Kit C v4
* 1 Screw Terminal Block Breakout Board for ES32 Dev Kit C
* 2 green LED lights
* 2 red LED lights
* 4 220-ohm resistors 
* 1 MAX 6675 + K-Type Thermocouple
* 1 MAX 4466 Microphone
* Varios jumper wires and breadboards as needed to make connections

Refer to the [Gateway Diagram](docs/Diagrams/Capstone_Gateway_Diagram.pdf) and [Sensor Diagram](docs/Diagrams/Capstone_Sensor_Diagram.pdf) as a guide to assemble the parts. 

### Setting Up Arduino IDE 1.8.19 for IDS Sensors and Gateway
Arduinoâ€™s IDE needs to be configured to compile its sketches appropriately for the ESP32.
** Disable any antivirus software temporarily for the next steps! **
1.	First in the Arduino IDE, go to the File menu and choose Preferences 
This should open a Preferences window. Within the Preferences window near the bottom, should be a text field labeled Additional Boards Manager URLs.
Copy the next two lines into the text field and press OK.
